// same project templates the picker uses, resolves the one whose name matches the
// argument, and hands it to openProject — the exact code path the picker runs when
// a project is chosen — so there is one source of truth for turning a template
// into a live workspace. This is the scriptable entry point a shell alias, a
// keybinding, another tool, or an AI agent can call to spin up a known workspace
// in a single shot. Like every herdr-plus command it reaches the running herdr
// over HERDR_SOCKET_PATH, so it must run inside herdr.

// stores our projects/ in. A direct invocation like `herdr-plus open <name>` from
// a shell has no such injection, so configBaseDir would fall back to the standalone
// ~/.config/herdr-plus and miss those projects. Here we ask the running herdr for
// the managed directory and export it ourselves — doing exactly what herdr would
// have done — so loadProjects reads the very same templates the picker would.
//
// Best effort: an already-set variable is left untouched, and if herdr cannot
// answer (not running, not found) we leave it unset and config keeps its standalone
// fallback. Setting a process env var here is safe: this is a short-lived one-shot
// command, and openProject drives herdr over the socket rather than spawning
