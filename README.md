# herdr-plus

herdr-plus is an add-on for [herdr](https://herdr.dev), built as a first-class
[herdr plugin](https://herdr.dev/docs/plugins/). It adds two things:

- **[Projects](#projects)** — declarative herdr-workspace templates you fuzzy-pick
  to spin up a whole workspace (every tab and pane, every startup command) in one
  keypress.
- **[Quick Actions](#quick-actions)** — a fuzzy launcher for one-off
  actions/scripts, run in the directory you launched from.

## About this fork

This is a fork of [cloudmanic/herdr-plus](https://github.com/cloudmanic/herdr-plus).
It tracks upstream and adds:

- **`pick_subdirectory`** — set `pick_subdirectory = true` on a project with a fixed
  `working_dir`, and opening it lists that directory's immediate subdirectories
  (shown by bare name) so one project file serves a whole folder of repos. Picking
  a subdirectory opens the workspace there, and the workspace takes the
  subdirectory's name as its label:

  ```toml
  name = "Pick a repo"
  working_dir = "~/dev"
  pick_subdirectory = true

  [[tabs]]
  name = "claude"
  command = "claude"
  ```

  Hidden directories are skipped, and it composes with `ctrl+g` (the worktree
  branch prompt follows the pick). Like `working_dir = "{prompt}"`, these
  projects can't be opened headless with `herdr-plus open <name>`.

## Install

herdr-plus is a herdr plugin (requires **herdr ≥ 0.7.0**). Installing it registers
the plugin's actions with herdr — no editing of your `config.toml`.

```bash
herdr plugin install mateogo42/herdr-plus
```

herdr clones the repo, runs the manifest's `[[build]]` step, and registers the
actions. That step **prefers a local Go toolchain** (an exact build of the source)
and **falls back to downloading the latest prebuilt release binary**, so it works
**with or without Go**. Manage it with `herdr plugin list`,
`herdr plugin action list --plugin mateogo42.herdr-plus`, and
`herdr plugin uninstall mateogo42.herdr-plus`.

> **Windows** (herdr's Windows support is in preview): the plugin installs and
> runs on Windows, but its build step compiles straight from source with the Go
> toolchain — there's **no prebuilt-binary fallback** like the Linux/macOS `sh`
> script has — so **Go must be on your `PATH`** to `herdr plugin install`. The
> plugin talks to herdr over a named pipe there instead of a unix socket; it's
> validated against the herdr Windows beta.

**Local development:** build the binary and link your checkout in place:

```bash
make build
herdr plugin link /path/to/herdr-plus     # or: make plugin-link
```

### Just the binary

If you'd rather have `herdr-plus` on your `PATH` (e.g. to run `herdr-plus version`),
prebuilt binaries are published on every release:

```bash
# Homebrew (the repo is its own tap)
brew tap mateogo42/herdr-plus https://github.com/mateogo42/herdr-plus
brew install mateogo42/herdr-plus/herdr-plus

# or the install script (Linux/macOS, no Homebrew)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mateogo42/herdr-plus/main/install.sh | sh
```

The binary on its own doesn't register the plugin with herdr — use
`herdr plugin install` (above) for that. Every merge to `main` cuts a new release
with cross-compiled binaries.

## Configuration

herdr-plus keeps its config in herdr's managed plugin directory — find it with:

```bash
herdr plugin config-dir mateogo42.herdr-plus
# → ~/.config/herdr/plugins/config/mateogo42.herdr-plus
```

Inside it, `projects/` holds your [project templates](#projects) and
`quick-actions/` your [actions](#quick-actions). herdr provisions this directory
and keeps it across uninstall/upgrade. (Running the binary *outside* herdr falls
back to `~/.config/herdr-plus/`, honoring `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.)

Optional global settings live in `config.toml` in that same directory:

```toml
[worktree]
branch_prefix = "your-name/" # used verbatim; include your own trailing /

[projects]
placement = "zoomed" # overlay, popup, split, tab, or zoomed; default is zoomed

[quick_actions]
placement = "overlay" # overlay, popup, split, tab, or zoomed; default is overlay
```

`placement` controls how herdr opens each picker — see herdr's
[`plugin pane open --placement`](https://herdr.dev/docs/plugins/#panes) for what
each value does. `popup` is a good fit for either picker if you want a small
floating window that leaves your tiled layout untouched, rather than the default
zoomed/overlay takeover. An empty or invalid value falls back to the built-in
default and prints a warning to stderr rather than being passed through to herdr.

## Projects

Pick a project from a full-screen fuzzy browser and herdr-plus builds its whole
workspace. Trigger it from herdr's plugin action menu, or
[bind a key](#binding-a-key) — the action is `mateogo42.herdr-plus.projects`.
Inside the browser, **Enter** opens the highlighted project as a normal workspace;
**ctrl+g** opens it as a git worktree. The worktree prompt accepts an optional
branch name: empty lets herdr generate `worktree/...`, bare names get the optional
`[worktree] branch_prefix`, and names containing `/` are used as-is.

Opening as a worktree fills its tabs from a matching
[worktree auto-layout](#worktree-auto-layout) — a file in `worktrees/` whose `repo`
matches — **not** the project's own `[[tabs]]`. Without a matching layout the
worktree opens with herdr's default single pane, so add a `worktrees/` file for any
repo you open this way.

A project is one TOML file in the `projects/` subdir of
[herdr-plus's config dir](#configuration). The file name doesn't matter; add a
file to add a project, delete it to remove it. With no files there, the browser
shows an onboarding card.

```toml
name = "Options Cafe"
description = "The main options.cafe monorepo"
working_dir = "~/Development/options-cafe/options.cafe"   # ~ and $VARS expand

[[tabs]]
name = "claude"
command = "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --chrome"

[[tabs]]
name = "lazygit"
command = "lazygit"

[[tabs]]
name = "terminal"   # no command — just an empty shell
```

Tabs open in file order. The first tab reuses the workspace's root tab; the rest
are created behind it. A tab with no `command` is just an empty shell.

### A directory per tab

The project's `working_dir` is where every tab starts. A tab — or a single pane —
can override it with its own `working_dir`, which is what a monorepo usually wants:

```toml
name = "Shop"
working_dir = "~/dev/shop"

[[tabs]]
name = "web"
working_dir = "frontend"   # relative to the project → ~/dev/shop/frontend
command = "npm run dev"

[[tabs]]
name = "api"
working_dir = "backend"    # → ~/dev/shop/backend
command = "make run"

[[tabs]]
name = "shell"             # no working_dir → the project's ~/dev/shop
```

A relative path is resolved against the project's `working_dir`, so `"frontend"`
means what it looks like. Absolute paths, `~`, and `$VARS` work the same as they do
at the project level. Panes inherit their tab's directory unless they set their own:

```toml
[[tabs]]
name = "stack"
working_dir = "frontend"

[[tabs.panes]]
command = "npm run dev"          # frontend/

[[tabs.panes]]
command = "psql shop"
split = "right"
working_dir = "../backend/db"    # its own directory instead
```

Every directory must exist. A missing one is reported before anything opens, so a
typo never leaves you a half-built workspace to clean up.

### Opening by name (headless)

The picker is interactive, but a project can also be opened directly — no browser,
no fuzzy-picking — with the `open` subcommand:

```sh
herdr-plus open harbor-sysadmin
```

It loads the same templates, resolves the one whose `name` matches (exactly, or
case-insensitively as a fallback), and builds its workspace through the **identical
code path** the picker uses — so there is a single source of truth for the layout.
A mistyped name fails with the list of available projects.

Run it from **inside herdr** (a pane shell, a keybinding, another tool): like every
herdr-plus command it reaches the running herdr over its socket, and it asks herdr
where your project templates live, so it finds the same ones the picker shows. This
is the scriptable entry point for spinning up a known workspace in one shot — handy
for shell aliases, scripts, and AI agents. (To get `herdr-plus` on your `PATH`, see
[Just the binary](#just-the-binary).)

### Grouping

A project may set an optional `group` to cluster related projects under a heading
in the browser (handy when one client has several). Projects sharing a `group` are
shown together; group-less ones fall under an **Ungrouped** heading. Grouping only
engages when at least one project sets a `group` — otherwise the list is plain.
Filtering ignores headings: start typing and it collapses to one ranked list.

### Split panes within a tab

A tab can hold up to **4 panes**. Instead of a single `command`, give it
`[[tabs.panes]]` entries. Each pane after the first sets `split` to `"down"`
(stacked) or `"right"` (side by side) — how it splits off the previous pane. An
omitted `split` defaults to `"down"`.
A pane may also set `ratio` — how much of that split it takes, between `0` and
`1`, leaving the rest to the pane it splits off. Omitted, the split is even.
Each pane may also set an optional `label` — the name herdr shows on the pane
border (when `show_agent_labels_on_pane_borders` is on). A blank or omitted
`label` leaves the pane's default name untouched.

```toml
[[tabs]]
name = "server"

[[tabs.panes]]
label = "Server"
command = "php artisan serve"

[[tabs.panes]]
label = "Assets"
command = "npm run dev"
split = "down"
ratio = 0.3
```

A tab uses *either* `command` *or* `[[tabs.panes]]`, not both.

## Quick Actions

A fuzzy launcher for one-off commands. Trigger it (action
`mateogo42.herdr-plus.quick-actions`), fuzzy-pick an action, and it runs in the
directory you launched from. Actions are TOML files in the `quick-actions/` subdir
of [herdr-plus's config dir](#configuration) (seeded with editable examples on
first run). A repo can also ship its own in `<repo>/.herdr-plus/quick-actions/`, shown
under a **Project** heading above your **Global** ones — this repo ships
`make build` / `make test` as a live example.

There are three action types:

```toml
# command (default) — runs immediately
name = "GitHub"
command = "open https://github.com"
```

```toml
# select — pick from a second fuzzy list; the choice becomes {{.Value}}
name = "Open Repo"
type = "select"
command = "open https://github.com/mateogo42/{{.Value}}"

[[options]]
label = "Herdr Plus"
value = "herdr-plus"
```

A select action can build its list at open time instead of hard-coding it. Set
`options_command` in place of `[[options]]` and it runs fresh every time the
action is picked, one option per line of stdout:

```toml
# select — options come from a command, so the list follows what is on disk
name = "New Project"
type = "select"
options_command = "ls -1 ~/projects"
command = "cd ~/projects/{{.Value}} && $EDITOR ."
```

`options_command` is templated exactly like `command`, so it can reference
`{{.WorkDir}}` and friends. A line becomes the option's label *and* value; add a
tab to give it a description — `herdr-plus\tinstalled` shows "installed" beside
the row without it ending up in `{{.Value}}`. If the command fails, the picker
shows the error as an unselectable row rather than an empty list.

```toml
# form — type a value that becomes {{.Value}}
name = "Search Google"
type = "form"
command = "open 'https://www.google.com/search?q={{.Value | urlquery}}'"

[form]
prompt = "Search Google for"
```

The `command` is a [Go template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) rendered against
the launch context: `{{.WorkDir}}` (where you launched from), `{{.SessionTitle}}`
(the workspace label), `{{.Value}}` (select/form input), and more — also exported
as `HERDR_PLUS_*` environment variables. If a command doesn't reference
`{{.Value}}`, the value is appended as a final shell-quoted argument.

## Worktree auto-layout

herdr-plus can lay a project-style tab layout into a git **worktree** the moment
herdr creates *or opens* it. When you run `herdr worktree create`/`open` (or use
herdr's right-click worktree dialog), herdr makes a fresh workspace for the
worktree and fires a `worktree.created` event (new worktree) or `worktree.opened`
event (existing one); herdr-plus catches either, finds a layout matching the
worktree's repo, and opens that layout's tabs and panes in the new workspace —
every command running — with no keypress. This is the plugin system's `[[events]]`
hook (declared in [`herdr-plugin.toml`](herdr-plugin.toml)) put to work.

Layouts live in `~/.config/herdr-plus/worktrees/`, one TOML file per layout (the
file name doesn't matter). A layout is a `repo` matcher plus the same `[[tabs]]`
format projects use:

```toml
repo = "options-cafe"          # matches the worktree's repo name (case-insensitive)

[[tabs]]
name = "claude"
command = "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --chrome"

[[tabs]]
name = "lazygit"
command = "lazygit"

[[tabs]]
name = "terminal"              # no command — just an empty shell
```

- **`repo`** (required) matches the new worktree's repository name — the repo's
  basename, e.g. `options-cafe` — case-insensitively. Set `repo = "*"` to create a
  **wildcard layout** that matches any repo (see below).
- **`branch`** (optional) narrows a layout to worktrees created on exactly that
  branch. When more than one layout matches, a branch-specific one wins over a
  repo-only one.
- **`[[tabs]]`** is identical to a project's tabs, including multi-pane
  `[[tabs.panes]]` splits (see [Split panes within a tab](#split-panes-within-a-tab)).

### Turning a layout on and off

The switch is simply **whether the file exists**. A layout in `worktrees/` is on;
to turn one off, delete the file (or move it out of the directory). With no files
in `worktrees/` at all, the feature is inert — every worktree fires the event, and
herdr-plus does nothing when nothing matches.

The handler's output shows up in `herdr plugin log list --plugin
mateogo42.herdr-plus`, so you can confirm whether a layout fired.

### Wildcard (generic) layouts

Set `repo = "*"` to define a layout that applies to **every** repo that doesn't
have its own specific layout — a generic project template:

```toml
repo = "*"

[[tabs]]
name = "claude"
command = "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --chrome"

[[tabs]]
name = "code-review"
command = "lazygit"

[[tabs]]
name = "terminal"
```

This is useful when you have many repos that all want the same workspace shape.
Instead of one file per repo, write one wildcard layout and you're done.

**Specificity:** when multiple layouts match a worktree, the most specific wins:

1. Repo + branch (e.g. `repo = "my-app"`, `branch = "main"`)
2. Repo only (e.g. `repo = "my-app"`)
3. Wildcard + branch (e.g. `repo = "*"`, `branch = "main"`)
4. Wildcard only (e.g. `repo = "*"`)

A repo-specific layout always beats a wildcard, so you can set a generic default
and still override individual repos when needed.

## Binding a key

Binding keys to the actions is an optional, one-time edit to **your** herdr
`config.toml` (`~/.config/herdr/config.toml`). Add `[[keys.command]]` entries with
`type = "plugin_action"` whose `command` is the action id:

```toml
[[keys.command]]
key = "prefix+up"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "mateogo42.herdr-plus.projects"
description = "herdr-plus: projects"

[[keys.command]]
key = "prefix+down"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "mateogo42.herdr-plus.quick-actions"
description = "herdr-plus: quick actions"
```

Then `herdr server reload-config` (or restart herdr) and press your herdr prefix
(default `ctrl+b`) followed by the bound key.

## Building

```bash
make build     # build ./bin/herdr-plus
make test      # go test -race ./...
make vet       # go vet ./...
```

The marketing + docs site lives in `www/` (Hugo + Tailwind). Build it with
`make site`, or run it locally with live reload via `make site-dev`.
