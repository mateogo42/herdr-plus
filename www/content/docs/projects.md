**Projects** are declarative herdr workspace templates that spin up a fully
laid-out workspace with a single keypress.

## What it does

Trigger the `cloudmanic.herdr-plus.projects` action — from herdr's action menu, or
a [bound key](../keybindings/) — and herdr-plus opens a **full-screen fuzzy
browser** of your projects.

Fuzzy-find a project, press `enter` (or click it), and herdr-plus spins up a whole
workspace — every tab created, every split laid out, and every startup command
running — then drops you straight into it. Cancel with `esc` to close the browser
and return to where you were.

> **Note:** With no project files yet, the browser shows an onboarding screen
> explaining how to add your first project.

## What a project is

A **project** is a declarative herdr workspace template: a name, a description, a
working directory, and an ordered list of tabs (each with an optional startup
command, or a set of split panes). It replaces hand-written workspace shell scripts
with a simple config file.

## Where projects live

Projects live in the `projects/` subdirectory of
[herdr-plus's config directory](../configuration/), **one TOML file per project**.
The file name doesn't matter — only its contents. Find the directory with:

```bash
herdr plugin config-dir cloudmanic.herdr-plus
```

The directory **starts empty**: unlike quick-actions, it is never seeded with
examples, because an empty directory is meaningful (it triggers the onboarding
screen). To add a project, drop a `.toml` file in. To remove a project, delete its
file.

## The project schema

Here is a complete, annotated example covering every field:

```toml
# Top-level project fields.
name = "Options Cafe"                                      # required: the workspace label
description = "The main options.cafe monorepo"             # shown in the browser
group = "Cloudmanic"                                       # optional: cluster a client's projects under a heading
working_dir = "~/Development/options-cafe/options.cafe"    # ~ and $VARS expand

# Tabs open in file order. The FIRST tab reuses the workspace's root tab; the
# rest are created behind it so the first tab stays in front.

[[tabs]]
name = "claude"                                            # required: the tab label
command = "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --chrome" # runs on startup

[[tabs]]
name = "lazygit"
command = "lazygit"

[[tabs]]
name = "terminal"                                          # no command — just an empty shell
```

### `name`

Required. The workspace label herdr-plus gives the project's workspace, and the
text you fuzzy-find in the browser.

### `description`

Optional free text shown next to the name in the browser.

### `group`

Optional. A label that clusters related projects in the browser — see
[Grouping projects by client](#grouping-projects-by-client). It has no effect on
the workspace that opens; it only changes how the browser is laid out.

### `working_dir`

The directory the workspace is rooted at. A leading `~` expands to your home
directory, and any `$VARS` in the path are expanded from your environment. An
empty (or `~`) `working_dir` defaults to your home directory, so a minimal
project still opens somewhere sensible.

> **Important:** The working directory's existence is checked when you *open* the
> project, not when the file is loaded. (The same project file might be valid on
> one machine and not another.) If the directory doesn't exist, opening the
> project fails with a clear error.

### `pick_subdirectory`

Optional. Set it with a fixed `working_dir` and opening the project lists that
directory's **immediate subdirectories** — shown by bare name — so one project
file serves a whole folder of repos:

```toml
name = "Pick a repo"
working_dir = "~/dev"
pick_subdirectory = true

[[tabs]]
name = "claude"
command = "claude"
```

Picking a repo opens the workspace in it, and the workspace takes the repo's
name as its label. Hidden directories are skipped. `pick_subdirectory` composes
with `ctrl+g` (the branch prompt follows the pick) and needs a **fixed**
`working_dir` (not `"{prompt}"`).

> **Note:** Like `working_dir = "{prompt}"`, a `pick_subdirectory` project
> can't be opened with `herdr-plus open <name>` — there's no picker to show the
> list.

### `[[tabs]]`

A project needs **at least one** `[[tabs]]` entry. Tabs are created in file
order. Each tab has:

- `name` — **required**, the tab's label.
- `command` — optional. The startup command, run as if typed at the prompt. A
  tab with no `command` (and no panes) is just an empty shell.
- `working_dir` — optional. The directory this tab starts in, overriding the
  project's. See [A directory per tab](#a-directory-per-tab).

The first tab reuses the workspace's root tab (it's renamed to the tab's name);
every later tab is created behind it.

## A directory per tab

The project's `working_dir` is where every tab starts. A tab can override it,
which is what a monorepo usually wants — the frontend and the backend each in
their own subdirectory:

```toml
name = "Shop"
working_dir = "~/dev/shop"

[[tabs]]
name = "web"
working_dir = "frontend"   # relative to the project → ~/dev/shop/frontend
command = "npm run dev"

[[tabs]]
name = "api"
working_dir = "backend"    # → ~/dev/shop/backend
command = "make run"

[[tabs]]
name = "shell"             # no working_dir → the project's ~/dev/shop
```

A **relative** path is resolved against the project's `working_dir`, so
`"frontend"` means what it looks like rather than something relative to wherever
herdr happens to be running. Absolute paths, `~`, and `$VARS` behave exactly as
they do at the project level.

Every directory must already exist. A missing one is reported *before* anything
opens, so a typo never leaves a half-built workspace behind.

## Split panes within a tab

A tab can hold up to **4 panes**. Instead of a single `command`, give the tab
`[[tabs.panes]]` entries:

```toml
[[tabs]]
name = "server"

[[tabs.panes]]
command = "php artisan serve"

[[tabs.panes]]
command = "npm run dev"
split = "down"
```

Each pane:

- `command` — optional. The command to run in that pane on startup. A pane with
  no command is an empty shell.
- `split` — how the pane is created relative to the *previous* pane in the tab:
  - `"down"` — stacked below (top/bottom).
  - `"right"` — beside it (side by side).
  - Omitted — defaults to `"down"`.
- `ratio` — optional. How much of the split this pane takes, between `0` and `1`.
  Omitted, the split is even.
- `working_dir` — optional. The directory this pane starts in. Omitted, it
  inherits its tab's. See [A pane in its own directory](#a-pane-in-its-own-directory).

The **first pane is the tab's root**, so its `split` and `ratio` are ignored.
Each later pane splits off the one before it.

### Sizing a split

`ratio` is the share the pane it is written on gets; the pane it splits off keeps
the rest. Here the editor fills three quarters of the tab and lazygit sits in the
last quarter:

```toml
[[tabs]]
name = "editor"

[[tabs.panes]]
command = "nvim"

[[tabs.panes]]
command = "lazygit"
split = "right"
ratio = 0.25
```

A ratio outside `0`–`1` (a percentage like `30`, say) is a load-time error rather
than a silently clamped layout.

### A pane in its own directory

Panes start in their tab's directory. A pane that wants a different one says so,
and the rest of the tab is unaffected:

```toml
[[tabs]]
name = "stack"
working_dir = "frontend"

[[tabs.panes]]
command = "npm run dev"          # frontend/

[[tabs.panes]]
command = "psql shop"
split = "right"
working_dir = "../backend/db"    # its own directory instead
```

A pane's `working_dir` resolves the same way a tab's does — relative to the
project's `working_dir`, with `~` and `$VARS` expanded.

### `command` vs. `[[tabs.panes]]` are mutually exclusive

A tab uses *either* `command` *or* `[[tabs.panes]]`, not both. Setting both is a
config error reported when the project loads. A tab with neither is a single
empty shell.

> **Tip:** In the projects browser, split tabs are shown with a `×N` pane count
> (e.g. `server ×2`) so you can see the layout at a glance.

A tab may declare at most 4 panes; more than that is a load-time error.

## Grouping projects by client

Give a project a [`group`](#group) and the browser clusters projects that share
that label under a heading. This is built for the common case where **one client
has several projects** — tag each with the client's name and they sit together:

```toml
name = "Acme — Web"
group = "Acme Co."
working_dir = "~/Clients/acme/web"

[[tabs]]
name = "editor"
command = "spiceedit"
```

How the browser lays out:

- **Headings appear only when used.** If no project sets a `group`, the browser
  is a plain, flat list — nothing changes.
- **Named groups come first**, in case-insensitive alphabetical order by group
  name. A client's projects keep their usual name order under the heading.
- **Group-less projects** fall under a catch-all **Ungrouped** heading at the
  bottom, so a mix of grouped and ungrouped projects is always clearly labeled.
- **Search is unchanged.** Start typing and the headings drop away — you filter a
  single ranked list across every project, grouped or not.

## Opening a project by name

The browser is interactive, but a project can also be opened directly — no picker,
no fuzzy-typing — with the `open` subcommand:

```sh
herdr-plus open harbor-sysadmin
```

It loads the same project templates the browser shows, resolves the one whose
`name` matches — exactly first, then case-insensitively, so `open Harbor-Sysadmin`
still finds `harbor-sysadmin` — and builds its workspace through the **same code
path** the browser uses. There is one source of truth for turning a template into a
live workspace. A name that matches nothing fails with the list of what is
available.

Run it from **inside herdr** — a pane's shell, a keybinding, a script, another
tool. Like every herdr-plus command it reaches the running herdr over its socket,
and it asks herdr where your templates live, so it finds exactly the ones the
browser shows.

That makes it the scriptable way to spin up a known workspace in one shot, which is
handy for the two or three projects you open constantly:

```sh
alias work='herdr-plus open my-work-app'
```

To get `herdr-plus` onto your `PATH`, see
[Just the binary](https://github.com/cloudmanic/herdr-plus#just-the-binary) —
installing the plugin alone does not put it there.

> **Note:** A project whose `working_dir` is `{prompt}` — or which sets
> [`pick_subdirectory`](#pick_subdirectory) — can't be opened this way: there's
> no picker to show. Use the browser for those.

## Adding and removing projects

The model is one file per project:

- **Add a project** — drop a new `.toml` file into the `projects/` subdirectory of
  [herdr-plus's config dir](../configuration/).
- **Remove a project** — delete its file.

Projects are sorted by name in the browser, and clustered under group headings
when any project sets a [`group`](#grouping-projects-by-client). A malformed or
invalid project file fails the whole load with a message naming the offending
file, so a config mistake surfaces loudly instead of a project silently going
missing.
