// run under, and how to quote a value for it. Everything OS-specific about
// running a command string lives here — the rest of the plugin calls
// shellCommand / shellQuote and stays free of runtime.GOOS checks.
//
// It matters only for quick actions, which the plugin executes itself (see
// action.go). Project and worktree tab commands are typed straight into a herdr
// pane and run by that pane's own shell, so they never pass through here.

// platform bundles everything about the host OS that quick-action execution
// varies on: the shell commands run under, how to quote a value for that shell,
// the pane-entrypoint suffix, and the default "open this" command. Selecting it
// once (currentPlatform) keeps a single OS switch here instead of one per
// concern — adding an OS is a new case, not four scattered edits.
